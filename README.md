Hello! My name is Manuel de Sousa. I've been a programmer since 2016, I have notions of different programming languages. But currently I'm focused on WEB programming, where day after day, I've been striving to be a FULL STAKE, I work with javascript (VUE.JS), and I'm also learning PHP when I can...

I am interested in acquiring new knowledge, ease of learning, leadership, dedication, agility, creativity, organization, and availability to work. Good presentation, dynamics and good direction.
